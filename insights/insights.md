# INSIGHTS
1. **QC Failures**
   - The biggest cause of failure is “Tech Not Certified.”
   - “Incorrect Testpoint Count” and “Missing Completed Date” also show up but less frequently.
   - Next steps involve verifying technicians are properly assigned and ensuring consistent metadata entry.

2. **Total Invoice Price by Branch**
   - Chicago stands out with the highest total. Phoenix and Los Angeles follow close.
   - Houston and New York are a bit lower, suggesting there may be room to encourage more accredited work.

3. **Invoices by Accreditation**
   - Most branches split between standard and accredited jobs fairly evenly.
   - Where standard calibrations dominate, revenue can be lower because accredited commands a premium.

4. **Test Point Distribution**
   - Nearly all calibrations follow the 10 (standard) or 15 (accredited) point rule.
   - Occasional deviations may indicate data-entry mistakes or extra thorough measurements.
